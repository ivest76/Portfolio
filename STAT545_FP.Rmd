```{r}

It takes 7.14 minutes to get 4 customers in line.

  line <- rpois(1, 6)

#Part 2

1.
```{r}
6/48
```


```{r}
1 - pnorm(0, mean = 6, sd = 1.65123*sqrt(48))
```


2.
Compute the probability that the home team wins the game given the home team is winning by 5 points after the third quarter.
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Downloads/IMG_FA46B1EAB2F3-1.jpeg")
```

```{r}
#we are letting sigma = 1.65123
1 - pnorm(-5, mean = 0.125*12, sd=1.65123*sqrt(12))
```


3.
Compute the probability that the home team is winning at the end of the third quarter given that the home team wins the game by 5 points.
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Downloads/IMG_868063B62FDE-1.jpeg")
```

```{r}
36/(sqrt(36)*sqrt(48))
```

```{r}
4.5+0.8660254*((5-6)/(1.65123*sqrt(48)))*1.65123*sqrt(36)
```

```{r}
1.65123*sqrt(36)*sqrt(1-(0.8660254**2))
```

```{r}
1 - pnorm(0, mean = 3.75, sd=4.95369)
```

a. 
I think mu has a normal distribution and sigma has a normal distribution. I'm going to choose values that are close to what we found in number 1. This is because I feel like the way the mean and standard deviation update in the simulation should result in the basketball game scores having reasonable differences (i.e. nothing larger than 20 points, maybe some close 1/2 point games.) 

```{r}
mu <- 0.1
sigma <- 1
```


b.
```{r}
rnorm(100000, mean = mu*48, sd = sigma*sqrt(48))
```

The probability the home team wins:
```{r}
1 - pnorm(0, mean = mu*48, sd = sigma*sqrt(48))
```

The expected difference in scores:
```{r}
mean(rnorm(100000, mean = mu*48, sd = sigma*sqrt(48)))
```

The maximum difference in scores:
```{r}
max(abs(rnorm(100000, mean = mu*48, sd = sigma*sqrt(48))))
```
